== Application setup

On this workshop, we will start using a very common scenario. 
A frontend application consuming service from an API in a backend (REST) application.

The backend application expose 3 services:

* Public 
* Secured (Requires user role)
* Admin  (Requires admin role)

To start, let's first fork the workshop repository to your own git. 

    https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/rhsso-workshop

As not everyone can build containers in your own machine, we will explore Quay.io to be responsable to fork 
the git repository and build the images based on a *Dockerfile*.

=== Frontend application

This is a simple frontend application.

* Access https://quay.io 
** Create a new repository named *demo-app*

image::images/quay-01.png[]

*** Select *Public* in Repository Visibility Option
*** Select *Link go a Github Repository Push* 
**** Select your user under Organization

image::images/quay-02.png[]

**** Select *rhsso-workshop* as your repository

image::images/quay-03.png[]

**** Select *Trigger for all branches and tags* as trigger option
**** Select */demo-app/Dockerfile* as Dockerfile
**** Select */demo-app* as Context

To test if we setup everything properly, lets trigger a build.

Edit the file demo-app/index.php changing the title to:

    <title>Your Name - Frontend App</title>

Commit and push the changes to github.

After commit, go to the Quay.io panel. A build should be running.

Congrats, you have a container ready to be deployed into Openshift.

=== Backend application

Now, we will repeat the process for the backend application.

This is a NodeJS application.

* Access https://quay.io 
** Create a new repository named *demo-service*
*** Select *Public* in Repository Visibility Option
*** Select *Link go a Github Repository Push* 
**** Select your user under Organization
**** Select *rhsso-workshop* as your repository
**** Select *Trigger for all branches and tags* as trigger option
**** Select */demo-service/Dockerfile* as Dockerfile
**** Select */demo-service* as Context

To test if we setup everything properly, lets trigger a build.

Edit the file demo-service/app.js changing the message on line 60 to:

    Public workshop

Commit and push the changes to github.

After commit, go to the Quay.io panel. A build should be running.

Congrats, you have a container ready to be deployed into Openshift.
