== Application setup

On this workshop, we will start using a very common scenario. 
A frontend application consuming service from an API in a backend (REST) application.

* Frontend - HTML5 application secured with Keycloak JavaScript adapter
* Backend - Node.js REST service secured with Keycloak Node.js adapter

The backend application expose 3 services:

* Public 
* Secured (Requires user role)
* Admin  (Requires admin role)

To start, let's first fork the workshop repository to your own git. 

    https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/rhsso-workshop

image::images/github-fork.png[]

In the next steps we will setup the application on Quay.io. It isn't mandatory since that we could easily 
deploy the project using Openshift S2I mechanism, but to show a differente approach we are suggesting to use 
Quay.

Another possibility, should be binary deployment, but as not everyone can build containers in your own machine, 
we will explore Quay.io to be responsable to fork the git repository and build the images based on a *Dockerfile*.

=== Frontend application

This is a simple frontend application.

* Access https://quay.io 
** Create a new repository named *demo-app*

image::images/quay-01.png[]

*** Select *Public* in Repository Visibility Option
*** Select *Link go a Github Repository Push* 
**** Select your user under Organization

image::images/quay-02.png[]

**** Select *rhsso-workshop* as your repository

image::images/quay-03.png[]

**** Select *Trigger for all branches and tags* as trigger option
**** Select */demo-app/Dockerfile* as Dockerfile
**** Select */demo-app* as Context

To test if we setup everything properly, lets trigger a build.

Edit the file demo-app/index.php changing the title to:

    <title>Your Name - Frontend App</title>

Commit and push the changes to github.

After commit, go to the Quay.io panel. A build should be running.

Congrats, you have a container ready to be deployed into Openshift.

=== Backend application

Now, we will repeat the process for the backend application.

This is a NodeJS application.

* Access https://quay.io 
** Create a new repository named *demo-service*
*** Select *Public* in Repository Visibility Option
*** Select *Link go a Github Repository Push* 
**** Select your user under Organization
**** Select *rhsso-workshop* as your repository
**** Select *Trigger for all branches and tags* as trigger option
**** Select */demo-service/Dockerfile* as Dockerfile
**** Select */demo-service* as Context

To test if we setup everything properly, lets trigger a build.

Edit the file demo-service/app.js changing the message on line 60 to:

    Public workshop

Commit and push the changes to github.

After commit, go to the Quay.io panel. A build should be running.

Congrats, you have a container ready to be deployed into Openshift.

== Deploy applications into Openshift

=== Deploying the backend application

* Under *Add to Project* menu, select *Deploy Image*

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-01.png[]

* Mark *Image Name* 

    quay.io/your-user-here/demo-service

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-02.png[]

* On Environment Variables add (adapt to your own values)

    KEYCLOAK_URL=https://sso-securityXX.apps.redhatrj-bf20.openshiftworkshop.com/auth

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-03.png[]

* If everything worked fine, you should see something like it

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-04.png[]

* Create a route
** Check *Secure route*

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-05.png[]

To do a quick test, access the route created with */public* in the end, you should see a json with the message attribute.

    https://demo-service-securityXX.apps.redhatrj-bf20.openshiftworkshop.com/public

=== Deploying the frontend application

You will basically repeat the same process. But in the environment variables you must insert the SERVICE_URL too.

    SERVICE_URL=https://demo-service-securityXX.apps.redhatrj-bf20.openshiftworkshop.com

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-06.png[]
image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-07.png[]
image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-08.png[]

To test, you can access the route and you will see a web application. If you click on *Invoke Public* 
you should see the message printed. 

image::images/rhsso-deploy-app-09.png[]

If you click on Login you will see a error message *"Client not found"*.

== Setup clients on RHSSO 

=== Demo Service Client

* On side menu, select *Clients*. Select *Add Client* and provide:
** Client ID: *demo-service*

** Root URL: *https://demo-service-security.apps.redhatrj-bf20.openshiftworkshop.com* (Adjust with your URL)

image::images/rhsso-client-setup-01.png[]

** Change Access Type to: *bearer-only*

image::images/rhsso-client-setup-02.png[]

=== Demo App Client 

* Client ID: *demo-app*
* Root URL: *https://demo-app-security.apps.redhatrj-bf20.openshiftworkshop.com* (Adjust with your URL)
